# Recursion
Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function. Using a recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. A few Java recursion examples are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.\
It is recommended that in a recursive function there should be at least 1 base case that terminates the recursion so that infinite recursions calls doesn't happen.

### Application of Recursion
If a problem has an iterative solution then the same solution can be implemented using recursion.
1. Many algorithm techniques based on recursion:
   * Dynamic Programming
   * Backtracking
   * Divide and Conquer (Binary Search, Quick Sort, Merge Sort etc.)
2. Many problems inherently recursive
   * Tower of Hanoi
   * DFS Based Traversal
   * In Order, Pre Order, Post Order Traversals of Trees
