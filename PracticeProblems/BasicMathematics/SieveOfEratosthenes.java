    /// Sieve Of Eratosthenes Algorithm -
    /// The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given number
    /// n in O(n log log n) time.
    ///
    /// Steps:
    /// 1. Create a boolean array isPrime[] of size n + 1 and mark all numbers as true (assuming all are prime initially).
    /// 2. Set isPrime[0] and isPrime[1] to false since 0 and 1 are not prime.
    /// 3. Start from the first prime 2 and mark all its multiples as false.
    /// 4. Repeat this for the next unmarked number (which is prime) and mark its multiples.
    /// 5. Continue until you reach âˆšn, since larger factors would have been marked already.
    /// 6. The numbers that remain true in isPrime[] are the prime numbers up to n.
